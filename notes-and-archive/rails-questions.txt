To figure out:
 * Once dependencies emerge for a Rails app (like the mysql gem), where are these described and handled for installation elsewhere?
 * How to use different JS libraries
 * It seems that a rake task can't be called more than once from another task:

  task :test_a_thing do
    cnt = 0
    until cnt == 3
      puts "doing it"
      Rake::Task['ts:version'].invoke
      puts "done"
      cnt += 1
    end
  end

And running this results in:

rake ts:test_a_thing
(in /home/shuckins/code/HTT)
doing it
Thinking Sphinx v1.3.14
done
doing it
done
doing it
done
